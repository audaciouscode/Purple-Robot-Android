    The battery probe reports the latest state of the device's portable power source.
    Since this information is broadcast by the system, values will only change when the system sends an update broadcast (typically when the battery percentage changes).

    In addition to the battery level, this probe reports the battery technology, health, temperature, current charging state, and other relevant variables.
