<h3>Discussion</h3>

<p>
    The accelerometer probes subscribes to the <code><a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/hardware/Sensor.html#TYPE_ACCELEROMETER">Sensor.TYPE_ACCELEROMETER</a></code> channel and buffers incoming values.
    When the value buffer fills up, the probe packages the values into several arrays:
</p>

<ul>
    <li><code>SENSOR_TIMESTAMP</code>: Sensor timestamp provided by the Android system in nanoseconds.</li>
    <li><code>EVENT_TIMESTAMP</code>: Time when the reading was provided to Purple Robot in milliseconds.</li>
    <li><code>NORMALIZED_TIMESTAMP</code>: Normalized timestamps in milliseconds computed by determining the time duration of the sensor buffer and applying an equal duration between each timestamp.</li>
    <li><code>ACCURACY</code>: Accuracy value reported by the Android system.</li>
    <li><code>X</code>, <code>Y</code>, and <code>Z</code>: Acceleration in meters per second<sup>2</sup> in the respective direction (including gravity).
</ul>

<p>
    A single sensor reading in these arrays are linked by the readings' index in the respective arrays.
</p>

<h3>Timestamps</h3>

<p>
    <code>SENSOR_TIMESTAMP</code>, <code>EVENT_TIMESTAMP</code>, and <code>NORMALIZED_TIMESTAMP</code> each exist and serve separate purposes.
</p>

<p>
    Values in the <code>SENSOR_TIMESTAMP</code> array are generated when the hardware emits a new sensor reading to the Android system.
    This value is expressed in nanoseconds and is attached to the <code><a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/hardware/SensorEvent.html">SensorEvent</a></code> object that Android sends to subscribers (such as this probe).
</p>

<p>
    When Purple Robot receives the <code>SensorEvent</code> object, it calculates the current wall-clock time and stores that in the <code>EVENT_TIMESTAMP</code> array.
    While the difference between the values in <code>SENSOR_TIMESTAMP</code> and <code>EVENT_TIMESTAMP</code> would ideally be minimal, these values may diverge significantly if the device is experiencing heavy load that increases the latency processing events in the event loop.
    These delays may be mitigated by setting the <code>use_thread</code> parameter to <code>true</code>, which instructs Android to create a dedicated event loop for the sensor.
    On devices with more than one CPU core, this effectively offloads the sensor processing to a separate core from the one processing the main event loop.
</p>

<p>
    Values in the <code>NORMALIZED_TIMESTAMP</code> array are intentionally spaced equidistantly from one another as if the sensor sampled at a truly constant rate.
    <code>NORMALIZED_TIMESTAMP</code> values should be used with caution and only in limited circumstances.
</p>

<h3>Wake Locks</h3>

<p>
    To prevent the device from going to sleep, this probe may be configured to hold a wake lock to keep the device at a minimum power level.
    On some devices, not holding this wake lock will allow the device to enter a sleep state, shutting down the sensors and introducing gaps in the data collection.
</p>

<p>
    The wake lock parameters above correspond to the following Android constants:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        <code>26</code> / <code><a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/PowerManager.html#FULL_WAKE_LOCK">PowerManager.FULL_WAKE_LOCK</a></code>: Ensures that the screen and keyboard backlight are on at full brightness.
    </li>
    <li>
        <code>10</code> / <code><a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/PowerManager.html#SCREEN_BRIGHT_WAKE_LOCK">PowerManager.SCREEN_BRIGHT_WAKE_LOCK</a></code>: Ensures that the screen is on at full brightness; the keyboard backlight will be allowed to go off.
    </li>
    <li>
        <code>6</code> / <code><a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/PowerManager.html#SCREEN_DIM_WAKE_LOCK">PowerManager.SCREEN_DIM_WAKE_LOCK</a></code>: Ensures that the screen is on (but may be dimmed); the keyboard backlight will be allowed to go off.
    </li>
    <li>
        <code>1</code> / <code><a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/PowerManager.html#PARTIAL_WAKE_LOCK">PowerManager.PARTIAL_WAKE_LOCK</a></code>: Ensures that the CPU is running; the screen and keyboard backlight will be allowed to go off.
    </li>
    <li>
        <code>-1</code>: No wake lock. The device may power down as needed.
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    Note that holding wake locks will disable the device's power management features and will result in significantly-decreased battery life.
