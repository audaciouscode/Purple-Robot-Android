    This probe is a feature that evaluates the readings produced by the <a href="call-state-probe.html">Current Call State Probe</a> and <a href="screen-probe.html">Screen Probe</a> to determine if the phone is actively in-use.
    The device is considered "in-use" if <em>either</em> of the following is true:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>The call state is  <code>Off-Hook</code>.</li>
    <li>The device screen is currently active.</li>
</ul>
