<p>Returns <code>true</code> when the system is fully initialized from a configuration document, <code>false</code> if the system has not yet successfully fetched and applied a configuration document.</p>

<h4>Discussion</h4>

<p>
    Purple Robot is typically configured using a remote document that is fetched by the mobile app and settings contained within are applied to the local Purple Robot instance. (See the <code><a href="all_update_config_url.html">PurpleRobot.updateConfigUrl</a></code> documentation for more details.
</p>

<p>
    When the system is instructed to fetch or update a configuration URL, that network request is made in a thread within the application that allows <code>PurpleRobot.updateConfigUrl</code> to return immediately so that the JavaScript execution context can be discarded and resources freed.
</p>

<p>
    When contents of the configuration URL are fetched, there are three outcomes that affect the timeliness when the system will be ready for subsequent calls:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>The network connection is reliable. The system is ready for commands almost immediately.</li>
    <li>The network connection is unreliable. Due to delays in fetching the configuration document, the system may not be ready for a highly variable amount of time.</li>
    <li>There is no network connection or another error. The system never fetches its configuration document and is never ready for subsequent commands.</li>
</ul>

<p>
    To address the issue of variability in when the system will be ready for subsequent commands, Purple Robot keeps an internal <em>ready</em> variable that is set to <code>false</code> when a new configuration URL is provided, and that variable remains <code>false</code> until the successful retrieval of the configuration document, when it is set to <code>true</code>.
    This method exposes that variable to external scripting contexts, so that third-party callers can implement their own strategies for dealing with this uncertainty.
</p>

<p>
    In JavaScript, this might be dealt with using a loop that waits for the system to become ready before continuing:
</p>

<pre>PurpleRobot.updateConfigUrl("http://www.example.com/config.js");

var whenReady = function()
{
	// System is ready, carry on...

	PurpleRobot.enableProbes();

	PurpleRobot.emitReading("foo", "bar");

	// ...
};

var numTries = 0;

window.setTimeout(function()
{
	if (PurpleRobot.isConfigurationReady())
	{
		whenReady();
	}
	else if (numTries > 30)
	{
		alert("Purple Robot is not configured properly. Bailing out...");

		return;
	}
	else
	{
		// Purple Robot not ready, sleep and try again in a minute...

		numTries += 1;

		window.setTimeout(this, 1000);
	}
}, 1000);
</pre>

<p>
    This JavaScript checks whether Purple Robot is ready once a second and executes the <code>whenReady</code> function when the system is configured.
    If the system is not configured within 30 tries (giving Purple Robot effectively a 30 second timer to fetch its configuration), the method bails out with an <code>alert</code> message.
</p>

<p>
    This is only meant as an example, and other apps should implement strategies that best match their own unique requirements.
</p>

<p>
	<em>Note:</em> This method indicates whether Purple Robot successfully fetched and processed the last given configuration URL. In situations where a new invalid configuration is used, the older configuration will remain active, so operations like <code><a href="all_emit_reading.html">PurpleRobot.emitReading</a></code> may still be successful when this method returns <code>false</code>.
	If you need to check whether sensor payloads are currently being persisted for later transmission, you may want to use the <code><a href="all_uploaders_enabled.html">PurpleRobot.uploadersEnabled</a></code> function instead.
